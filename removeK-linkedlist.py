Note: Try to solve this task in O(n) time using O(1) additional space, where n is the number of elements in the list, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers l and an integer k, remove all elements from list l that have a value equal to k.

Example

For l = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 3, the output should be
removeKFromList(l, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k = 10, the output should be
removeKFromList(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] linkedlist.integer l

A singly linked list of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ list size ≤ 105,
-1000 ≤ element value ≤ 1000.

[input] integer k

An integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
-1000 ≤ k ≤ 1000.

[output] linkedlist.integer

Return l with all the values equal to k removed.
